The ratio on the label (like 80/20 or 93/7) tells you lean meat versus fat. These ratios are largely determined by the feeding program—whether the cattle were grass-fed and grain-finished (conventional) or 100% grass-fed. Most people choose based on what they're making and their personal preferences around fat content.

## Everyday Ground Beef (80/20 and 85/15)

This is your versatile, flavorful ground beef that works for most applications. It has enough fat to stay juicy and create rich flavor without being greasy.

**Common ratios:**

- **80/20** — Most common in conventional (grass-fed/grain-finished) beef
- **85/15** — Most common in 100% grass-fed beef

### What makes it work

The fat renders during cooking and bastes the meat from the inside, keeping everything moist and flavorful. You'll get some rendered fat in the pan, but it's manageable and often desirable—it's what makes burgers juicy and gives chili its richness.

### Best for:

- Burgers
- Meatloaf
- Meatballs
- Tacos
- Chili
- Bolognese
- Pasta sauces
- Casseroles
- Anything where you want rich, beefy flavor

### The deal

This is your default ground beef for most cooking. It's forgiving, flavorful, and what most recipes assume you're using. The 80/20 (conventional) has a bit more fat and richer flavor; the 85/15 (grass-fed) is slightly leaner but still plenty juicy.

## Leaner Ground Beef (90/10 and 93/7)

This is ground beef with significantly less fat—great when you're specifically looking to reduce fat content or when other ingredients are bringing moisture and richness to the dish.

**Common ratios:**

- **90/10** — Available in both conventional and grass-fed
- **93/7** — Most common in 100% grass-fed beef

### What makes it work

With less fat, these cook up firmer and leaner. The beef flavor is cleaner and less rich, which can be a feature when you want the meat to complement rather than dominate a dish.

### Best for:

- Recipes with lots of other ingredients (pasta with tons of veggies, casseroles)
- Dishes where you're adding other fats (cheese, cream, sour cream)
- When you're specifically watching fat/calorie intake
- Lighter sauces where you don't want heavy beef flavor
- Meal prep when you want to control fat content

### The deal

These ratios need more attention—they can dry out if overcooked, and they benefit from added moisture through sauces, broths, or other ingredients. They're not ideal for burgers unless you're adding binders and fat. Think of this as the "I'm being mindful about fat but still want beef" option.

For 93/7 especially, you'll want to avoid overcooking and consider cooking in liquid or sauce rather than just browning in a dry pan.

## The Short Version

**Everyday (80/20, 85/15):** Your default choice—juicy, flavorful, versatile. Works for everything from burgers to chili. 80/20 is most common in conventional beef, 85/15 in grass-fed.

**Leaner (90/10, 93/7):** When you specifically want less fat or when other ingredients are bringing moisture and richness. Needs more attention to avoid drying out.

**The real talk:** Fat = flavor and moisture. Most home cooking benefits from the everyday ratios (80/20 or 85/15). Save the leaner options for when you actually need them to be lean or when your recipe has plenty of other fats and moisture built in.
