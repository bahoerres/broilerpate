## Introduction Talking Points
- No antibiotics, ever. If an animal needs antibiotic treatment, it is separated from those bought by our Meat department.
- No added growth hormones through feed, injections, implants, or any other method. (*Federal regulations allow the use of hormones when raising cattle and lambs, but we don't.*)
- No animal by-products in the feed, including feather meal or rendered fat.
- Beef cattle, sheep, and goats must spend at least two-thirds of their life on pasture.
- No crates, cages, or tethers are permitted.
- Animal producers must meet our standards for how the animals are raised, transported, and slaughtered.
- A traceable audit system is required that tracks animals from birth to slaughter.
- Required inspections for animal welfare at slaughter, using criteria and areas of evaluation developed by Dr. Temple Grandin.
